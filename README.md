# Projects

1. [Sales Analysis End to End Data Engineering Project Using Azure Cloud Services and Power BI](https://github.com/TahsinPavel/Sales-Analysis-End-to-End-Data-Engineering-Project-Using-Azure-Cloud-Services-and-Power-BI): In this project, I have developed a robust data architecture using Azure services. Specifically, I utilized Azure Data Lake Gen2 for storage, Azure Data Factory for pipeline creation to facilitate data movement and transformation, and Azure Synapse Analytics for efficient data warehousing and analytics. The data cleaning and transformation process is handled seamlessly with Azure Databricks, leveraging the power of Spark. To visualize the analysis, Microsoft Power BI is employed, creating interactive and up-to-date dashboards. The automation implemented ensures that with the upload of new data to the data warehouse, the entire process is triggered automatically, resulting in the latest reports being updated in Power BI. This real-time updating mechanism ensures that decision-makers have access to the most current insights. Overall, this architecture is well-integrated, scalable, and designed to handle end-to-end data processing and analytics workflows efficiently, embracing modern cloud-based solutions for enhanced scalability and flexibility.
   
2. [Resume Classification](https://github.com/TahsinPavel/Resume-Classification): This project is a comprehensive solution for automating the task of resume categorization and analysis.

3. [Machine Learning Model for Predictive Maintenance](https://github.com/TahsinPavel/Machine-Learning-Model-for-Predictive-Maintenance-): A major problem faced by businesses in asset-heavy industries such as manufacturing is the significant costs that are associated with delays in the production process due to mechanical problems. Most of these businesses are interested in predicting these problems in advance so that they can proactively prevent the problems before they occur which will reduce the costly impact caused by downtime. In this project azure IOT dataset set is used to predict Machine failure.
   
4. [Face Age progression using triple consistancy and identity loss](https://github.com/TahsinPavel/Age-progression-using-triple-consistancy-and-identity-loss): This Project based on my undergrad thesis "Enhancing StarGAN with Identity Loss, Pixel Loss and Triple Consistency Loss for Face Age Progression". Using Star Generative Adversarial Network, this model generate human face images for given age clusters. The model trained on FFHQ-Aging dataset and tested on UTK-FACE dataset.

5. [Handwritten Digit Recognition with PyTorch](https://github.com/TahsinPavel/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-with-PyTorch): This convolution neural network model that trained with MNIST Handwritten digit dataset. The model can recognize Handwritten digit with the accuracy of 98%. The Loss function of this model is about 0.0003%.
